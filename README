# Listeria_spread_movies

This folder contains time-lapse data of Listeria monocytogenes spread from cell to cell.
The bacteria (in red or green) are swimming inside the cytoplasm of gut-like human cells (nuclei in blue).
Note how some bacteria travel much farther than others.

The WT_WT movie refers to wild-type bacteria (red) spreading inside wild-type human cells.
The ActA-del movie shows a mutant bacterium (red) that has lost the ability to move from cell to cell.
